# pyZodipic
A Python Implementation of Zodipic

## What is Zodipic
"ZODIPIC synthesizes images of exozodiacal clouds. As a default, ZODIPIC creates an image of the solar zodiacal cloud as seen from 10 pc, but it contains many parameters that are tweakable from the command line, making it a handy general-purpose model for optically-thin debris disks that yields both accurate images and photometric information simultaneously. Written in IDL, ZODIPIC includes dust with real optical constants, user-specified dust maps and can compute images as seen through a linear polarizer." [1]

## What is this pyZodipic 
PyZodipic is a project to rewrite Zodipic in Python from its original IDL. 
In the end it is expected to work exactly the same as when it is in IDL.
